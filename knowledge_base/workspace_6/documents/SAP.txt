Creating documentation for an SAP Data Model (whether for SAP HANA Calculation Views, CDS Views, or BW/4HANA objects) is critical for maintainability and governance. A good data model document bridges the gap between business requirements and technical implementation.
Below is a comprehensive Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) and Template for documenting SAP Data Models.
________________


1. Document Control Information
Start every document with metadata to track changes and ownership.
Attribute
	Details
	Object Name
	CV_SALES_ACTUALS_YTD (Example)
	Object Type
	Calculation View / CDS View / ADSO
	Module/Domain
	SD (Sales & Distribution) / FI (Finance)
	Owner
	Data Architecture Team
	Last Updated

	Status
	Active / Deprecated / In Development

2. Business Context & Scope
This section explains "Why" this model exists, ensuring non-technical stakeholders understand its purpose.
2.1 Functional Description
* Goal: Briefly describe what business question this model answers.
* Example: "This model aggregates daily sales order line items to provide Year-To-Date (YTD) revenue analysis by region and product category."
* Key KPIs: List the measures calculated (e.g., Net Revenue, Gross Margin, Sales Quantity).
2.2 User Audience
* Who consumes this data? (e.g., Regional Sales Managers, CFO Dashboard).
* Which frontend tools connect here? (e.g., SAP Analytics Cloud, PowerBI, Fiori Apps).

3. Technical Architecture & Design
This is the core for developers and architects. It details "How" the model works.
3.1 Data Flow Diagram
Visuals are essential here. Insert a screenshot of your HANA view or a generated lineage diagram.

3.2 Source Tables / Objects
List the raw tables or lower-level views feeding this model.
Source Object
	Type
	Description
	Join Type
	Cardinality
	VBAK
	Table
	Sales Document: Header Data
	Left Outer
	1:N
	VBAP
	Table
	Sales Document: Item Data
	Inner
	1:1
	KNA1
	Table
	Customer Master
	Left Outer
	1:1
	3.3 Join Logic & Filters
* Join Conditions: Specify the keys used (e.g., VBAK.VBELN = VBAP.VBELN).
* Static Filters: Document any hard-coded filters applied at the source (e.g., MANDT = '100' or DOC_TYPE = 'OR').

4. Field Mapping & Transformation Logic
This is the most frequently referenced section for debugging.
Note: If you use complex SQL expressions or calculated columns, paste the exact logic here.
Field Name (Target)
	Source Field
	Data Type
	Logic / Formula
	Description
	CUSTOMER_ID
	KNA1.KUNNR
	NVARCHAR(10)
	Direct Mapping
	Unique customer identifier
	NET_VALUE_LC
	VBAP.NETWR
	DEC(15,2)
	IF(CURR='USD', NETWR, NETWR*EXCH_RATE)
	Net value converted to Local Currency
	SALES_YEAR
	VBAK.AUDAT
	CHAR(4)
	YEAR(AUDAT)
	Extracted year from order date

5. Performance & Partitioning
Critical for large datasets in SAP HANA/BW.
* Input Parameters: List any mandatory prompts (e.g., IP_YEAR, IP_REGION) that filter data before execution to improve speed.
* Partitioning Strategy: Is the underlying table partitioned? (e.g., Hash partitioned by GL_Account).
* Engine: Specify if the execution is forced to SQL Engine or Calculation Engine.
________________


6. Security & Authorization
Define who is allowed to see data within this model.
* Analytic Privileges: Does the model restrict data by region or company code?
   * Example: AP_SALES_US (Restricts view to Country = 'US').
* Data Masking: Are sensitive fields (like SSN or Salary) masked?

7. Troubleshooting & Lineage
* Dependency Tree: What happens if this view fails? (e.g., "Impacts the CEO's Daily Sales Report").
* Common Errors: Document known issues (e.g., "Duplicate records occur if Order Status is not filtered").
